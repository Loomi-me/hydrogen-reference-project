<img alt="img.png" src="readme_assets/visually_plus.png" width="700"/>

This project serves as a reference implementation for integrating Visually with Shopify Hydrogen storefronts.
It demonstrates how to set up the Visually integration to enhance your headless commerce experience.
The example is Based on [Hydrogen quickstart tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/headless/hydrogen/getting-started):

### Visually Integration Overview

Most of the necessary code for the Visually integration is located in a single file:
You are encouraged to explore the code its code to get the feeling of how the integration works.
- `app/components/Visually.jsx` ( [Visually.jsx](app/components/Visually.jsx)) 


<span style="font-size:1.25em"><b>It Includes the core functionality of the Visually integration implementation.</b><br/>
  The integration revolves around two main aspects:</span>

### The "Instrument" 

an interface implementation that provides programmatic control over store operations required for Visually Upsells and Analytics:
  - Cart management (add/remove items, open/close cart drawer, update cart attributes)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Implementing the update cart-attributes method in the Visually instrument  
> is crucial as it serves several essential purposes:
> - Detecting the SPA sales channel
> - Attributing orders to experiences for analytics purposes
> - Advanced Checkout targeting for upsells and recommendations and preview of Checkout upsells
> - Tracking subscription contracts in orders
>
> Make sure this functionality is properly implemented to ensure accurate tracking and analysis.

For the Full list of methods and properties required for the instrument interface, please refer to [Visually.d.ts](Visually.d.ts)


### Store State Reflection

Visually needs to know the current state of the store, including:
  - Current cart state
  - Current product and variant information
  - Current page type (e.g., product page, collection page, etc.)

## Key Integration Points

Or files that import the `Visually.jsx` components and Methods.

### Adding the visually.io scripts to the document <head> And Configuring the Alias and Api key

 - `app/root.jsx` ( [root.jsx](app/root.jsx) )

  <img alt="img.png" src="readme_assets/img.png" width="700"/>

The Alias and Api key can be found in the [Visually dashboard](https://app.visually.io/dashboard) after you install the Visually app.

Account Settings > Manual Script Integration
 

### Allowlisting visually io domain scripts in the CSP header

- `app/entry.server.jsx` ( [entry.server.jsx](app/entry.server.jsx) ) 

<img alt="img_2.png"  src="readme_assets/img_2.png" width="700"/>

Notice that we also need to be allowd as `connectSrc` and also please include the `unsafe-eval` in the `scriptSrc`
Visually uses `eval` in order to generate and execute dynamic javascript.

### Initializing Visually SDK

- `app/components/PageLayout.jsx` ( [PageLayout.jsx](app/components/PageLayout.jsx) )

This component initializes the Visually SDK with the instrument interface and store state reflection.
It's a simple wrapper around a hook `useVisuallyConnect` from `app/components/Visually.jsx`<br/>
In this example it uses the In this example it uses the hydrogen [`useCart`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/hydrogen-react/2025-04/hooks/usecart) hook.<br/>
It also uses the `useAside()` hook to open and close the cart drawer.<br/>
For this reason it needs to be a descendant of `CartProvider` component. And the `AsideProvider`<br/>
However this is not the only way to implement the instrument interface.<br/>
Your project may be different, you may use different hooks and your own custom implementation.<br/>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**:
Visually.jsx implements different object transformer functions that receive the cart and current product as parameters,
> and return a transformed object used by the Visually SDK to track the current state of the store.
> Your implementation may differ, but the main idea is to provide visually runtime the Cart and Current Product objects
> in the shape it expects.
> see Visually.d.ts for the full type definitions of the `Cart` and `CurrentProduct` objects that should be returned by the transformer functions.



### Notify visually when a pdp is loaded with its specific product and also when a variant is selected

- `app/routes/products.$handle.jsx` ( [products.$handle.jsx](app/routes/products.%24handle.jsx) )
 
<img alt="img_3.png"  src="readme_assets/img_3.png" width="700"/>


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: 
Visually Scripts are intentionally at the top of the `<head>` in the document.
In order to prevent flickering and delays our javascript sdk needs to run as fast as possible on every page load.

This project serves as a reference implementation for integrating Visually with Shopify Hydrogen storefronts. It demonstrates how to set up the Visually integration to enhance your headless commerce experience.
The project is Based on the following [Hydrogen quickstart tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/headless/hydrogen/getting-started):

### Visually Integration Overview

Most of the necessary code for the Visually integration is located in a single file:
- `app/components/Visually.jsx` ( [Visually.jsx](app/components/Visually.jsx)) 

<span style="font-size:1.25em"><b>It Includes the core functionality of the Visually integration implementation.</b><br/>
  The integration revolves around two main aspects:</span>

1. The "Instrument" interfaceâ€”Provides programmatic control over store operations Required for Visually Upsells and Analytics:
  - Cart management (add/remove items, open/close cart drawer)

2. Store State Reflection. Required event tracking for key store changes:
  - Cart modifications
  - Product page navigation
  - Variant selection
  - Other relevant state changes

## Key Integration Points

Or files that import the `Visually.jsx` components and Methods.

### Adding the visually.io scripts to the page <head> And Configuring the Alias and Api key

 - `app/root.jsx` ( [root.jsx](app/root.jsx) )

  <img alt="img.png" src="readme_assets/img.png" width="700"/>

The Alias and Api key can be found in the [Visually dashboard](https://app.visually.io/dashboard) after you install the Visually app.
Account Settings > Manual Script Integration
 

### Allowlisting visually io domain scripts in the CSP header

- `app/entry.server.jsx` ( [entry.server.jsx](app/entry.server.jsx) ) 

<img alt="img_2.png"  src="readme_assets/img_2.png" width="700"/>

Notice that we also need to be allowd as `connectSrc` and also please include the `unsafe-eval` in the `scriptSrc`
Visually uses `eval` in order to generate and execute dynamic javascript.

### Initializing Visually SDK

- `app/components/PageLayout.jsx` ( [PageLayout.jsx](app/components/PageLayout.jsx) )

This component initializes the Visually SDK with the instrument interface and store state reflection.
Its a simple wrapper around a hook `useVisuallyConnect` from `app/components/Visually.jsx`<br/>
In this example it uses the In this example it uses the hydrogen [`useCart`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/hydrogen-react/2025-04/hooks/usecart) hook.<br/>
It also uses the `useAside()` hook to open and close the cart drawer.<br/>
For this reason it needs to be a descendant of `CartProvider` component. And the `AsideProvider`<br/>
However this is not the only way to implement the instrument interface.<br/>
Your project mau be different and you may use different hooks or even your own custom implementation.<br/>

### Notify visually when a pdp is loaded with its specific product and also when a variant is selected

- `app/routes/products.$handle.jsx` ( [products.$handle.jsx](app/routes/products.%24handle.jsx) )
 
<img alt="img_3.png"  src="readme_assets/img_3.png" width="700"/>
## Notice !
<img alt="img_4.png"  src="readme_assets/img_4.png" width="700"/>

Visually Scripts are intentionally at the top of the `<head>` in the document.
In order to prevent flickering and delays our javascript sdk needs to run as fast as possible on every page load.
